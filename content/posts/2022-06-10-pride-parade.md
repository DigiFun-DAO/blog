The Pride Parade is a celebration of the LGBTQIA+ community marching in support of their rights.

Pride parades vary in location and date and are held around June and July each year to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall movement. Some of the more notable cities for Pride Parades include London, Paris, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Taipei, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, and Sydney.

Since its inception, Decentraland has been committed to building an open and inclusive metaverse, and in 2021, Decentraland is launching Pride Month with its first-ever Pride Parade, a month-long celebration where all wearable people can participate in a parade with the wearable display. The parade also includes a carnival float, stilt walkers, unicorns, and other segments where participants can enjoy a wealth of interactive experiences, such as coloring a rainbow road with a bucket of paint, and more.

In 2022, Decentraland's parade celebration is on schedule. This year's Pride Parade will begin at 9 p.m. UTC on June 11 (5 a.m. BST on June 12) and run through the end of June. The event will run around the clock, allowing new visitors to participate in the celebration every time they visit Decentraland, including musical performances, as well as interactive experiences such as parade floats and conversations.

The event will carry out the slogan "love is love". According to Lara Dias, event manager and senior producer of Decentraland, the long-awaited "kissing" emoji will make its debut during the event, allowing avatars to kiss and express their feelings for each other. In addition, couples of all sexual orientations will be able to get married in the metaverse and receive a certificate from NFT.

To celebrate this year's Pride Month, DigiFun has teamed up with LGBTQIA+ designer [Morchen](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/morchenliu/) to bring the NFT wearable "Phoenix Pride Wings". DigiFun will wear it in the parade, and this wearable will only be used in Decentraland.

Mo Chen, who has a background as a Chinese designer, graduated with first-class honors in fashion design from the University of Hertfordshire in 2019, the same year his eponymous brand [Mochic](https://twitter.com/Mochicofficial) was founded in London. He often draws inspiration from people and nature, incorporating silhouettes and colors into his designs with a unique sense of fun. Less than six months after first joining NFT and Metaverse, his digital fashion artworks have already been recognized by crypto art collectors around the world.

In this collaboration, Mo Chen uses the most representative rainbow elements of LGBTQIA+ to create a light sense of shape by layering, inlaying and fusing rows to present this visually striking pair of wings.

The pronunciation of "wings" is similar to that of "wins". DigiFun hopes that through the construction of a personal avatar, the wearer will have the courage to become whomever they want to be, no matter where they are.
