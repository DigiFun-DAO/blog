Metaverse, Web 3.0 and blockchain are the most popular buzzwords today. From fashion to beauty to luxury jewelry, the metaverse track is not only getting more crowded, but the speed of layout is also accelerating. But the faster the layout of the fashion technology field, the more difficult it is to balance technology and cultural values.

According to several media reports, nearly two-thirds of U.S. cryptocurrency investors are men. A related issue in the female population is that the world of web3 still has a lot to do. The NFT space is still dominated by men: [only 16 percent of NFT artists are female](https://arttactic.com/product/nft-art-market-report-november-2021/). Cryptocurrency marketplace Gemini revealed [only 26 percent of crypto investors are women](https://www.gemini.com/learn/women-and-crypto-new-frontier).

In a recent research report titled "What Women Want in Web 3.0," released by EWG Unlimited, the innovation arm of Elite World Group, a leading modeling agency, in collaboration with The FemaleQuotient, it was revealed that women make up nearly half of all online platform users. But for too long, both as users and creators, they have been marginalized from the cutting edge of technological innovation in Web 3.0.

### How women are working together for equity

Some Web3 communities work to break the bias by providing educational courses from female mentors. There is no doubt that it is important to address women's technology barriers through education.

Yeah I would like to chime in on that too. I think the ways to get more women into space is definitely to have more YouTube content, something visual. For example, I'm a visual learner so I feel like maybe some of us in the Community, including myself, can make videos on how artists can step their way into the metaverse. So definitely education on YouTube and maybe Google Docs or anything visual that can help. Those would be my two suggestions.

I very much agree on education and I've actually been working on it on a small level myself, eventually we'll probably bring it more to the group face to face. But I personally don't have 65 minutes to watch an entire YouTube video to learn how to do one thing, so I've been coming up with one minute or less videos walkthrough quick tutorials that eventually I will. You know, try to get out more often, so education is huge.
They are going to need something very simple. A down and dirty lesson that doesn't make him feel real stupid or overwhelmed because sadly, that's sometimes is the case for women in our culture.

I think for me, from my perspective of coming from the world of advertising, it's all the things that we're doing, Building community. Because honestly, in this space, if you aren't uplifting people and you aren't trying to build something with other people and you're trying to be closed off and you know you're trying to do it, in your own way, or not necessarily your own way, but in a way where you're like, sheltering everybody from you, then you're probably not going to be successful.
Uplifting women and and queer people in the space and giving them platforms you know, for them to be seen and for their work to be seen.Just like keeping those same values in the community you build around your brand or product.


### Brand leaders need to focus on women's needs

The fact is, women have an incredible amount of influence in business and branding strategies, whether it’s in the purchase decisions, the creation of brand strategies, or the overall leadership and direction of a company.

Women in technology. Women in crypto. Women just in this sector alone is such a hard find, right? I feel like us in this Twitter space, I feel like we're already like a rare breed in this industry. So it's really cool to run into people here. And it's definitely very motivating.

It's just so cool to see how many women and females have joined this space since I've been here and it just makes me really happy seeing and knowing we are able to multiply a little bit more and more each day. And I I think that should be some of our goals too.

Connection is critical, and I think young women in particular are ready to engage and experience. Yaping, can I ask you about your experience as a female creator and wearable creator? Do you think Web 3 at this stage is more male aesthetic biased? Do you think your dress can elevate women in the tech space?

#### YAPING CHEN
@YAPING_FASHION
There are more male players in this network which makes more male wearables in the marketplace. Design is also in line with male athletic characteristics. I hope that the five elements can be seen by more people so that more female players can dress when they enter the metaverse, which is also a respect for women so that they have more options.

While females are undervalued for their contribution in educating and onboarding women into Web3, women have to secure representation and fight for their rights together.

As the latest evolution of the internet and the next frontier of digital innovation, women must have an equal say in the Web 3.0 decision-making process.
