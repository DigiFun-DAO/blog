In the Gregorian calendar, the Mid-Autumn Festival occurs in September or October.

It is a harvest festival that dates back more than 3,000 years to moon worshiping in  the Shang Dynasty, when people worship god for a good harvest. It is as important as thanksgiving.

The Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for families to reunite and worship the moon.The most popular food during this festival is the mooncake, which is why the festival is also known as the Mooncake Festival.

From ancient to modern times,  Lanterns are everywhere during the Mid-Autumn Festival, and now from real life to the metaverse.

For this event, DigiFun prepared a lantern guessing trivia game. Among the dozens of lanterns in the building, ten of them are filled with riddles. If one cracks all the riddles, the player can get a Moon Goddess wearable designed by  DigiFun！

At the same time, players can also go to Dragon City to experience the sun shooting game. This mini-game displays the story of a traditional legend.

As the legend goes, Chang'e and her husband Hou Yi were a loving couple on earth. At that time, there were ten suns in the sky, and people were devastated. Hou Yi was a powerful archer, and he decided to shoot down nine of the suns, and was respected as a hero. In return, Hou Yi got an elixir of immorality from the gods. One day, a person tried to steal the elixir when Hou Yi wasn’t home. To save the elixir , Chang e drank it and flew to the moon. She then became the moon goddess.

The event was co-organized by DigiFun, DragonCity, and Decentraland officials, and attracted many players interested in the Mid-Autumn festival as well as young people growing up in a Chinese cultural context.
