The 2nd annual Metaverse Music Festival (MVMF) hosted by Decentraland, a metaverse platform, was held from November 10 to 13th, 2022. The 2022 festival was centered in the ‘cyberpunk city of the future’ and has attracted more than 100 artists including Vladimir Cauchemar of Universal Music France, CryptoPunk rapper Spottie WiFi, and Japanese girl group Atarashii Gakko, Ozzy Osbourne.

In anticipation of this great event, DigiFun teamed up with the awesome DCL project Metatrekkers to host a party, in addition to hot music by DJ Big Mouth, we conducted an interview that was broadcasted live on decentraland and DigiFun discord. 

We discussed the relationship between artists, musicians and the metaverse, including how to bring in and support artists, and plans for the future of the metaverse.

**Q1 : What do artists seek for in the metaverse？**

I think they want to get exposure,notoriety, have a good time and find a platform that is going to elevate them. I think they want a combination of things to take them to a place they’ve never been before.

**Q2 : What is the purpose of bringing in DJs?**

Our goal for the entertainment side is to be the Coachella of the metaverse, it is our dream. Nobody is in the space, it's brand new. And I think it is a  good time for us to grow and build new space. There are no limits, the only thing that can limit you is yourself.


**Q3 : What is the difference between online and offline concerts?**

The Coachella is real life, you will have to find venues, intermediaries, organize everything physically which takes a lot of time and energy. And when artists perform they can only perform domestically. Now, when you perform in the metaverse, you perform internationally and have no geographical boundaries. The cost will be low because you have no overhead like you are having in the real world. You will have more resources, because a lot of artists are more inclined to work with you if they don’t need to leave their house and travel. I think it goes against all the old habits and rules.

**Q4 : How do you support artists financially?**

In the beginning, we needed to apply for a grant to get it started. In the future we can start token gating, like a VIP access. I can start to think of ways to compensate them by token gating. A token is a NFT (non-fungible token). Once people get your NFT they can have access to exclusivity by you, and can have access to it for a long time.  For MetaTrekkers, our token will have access to limitless events. For example, if people purchase DigiFun wearable, the wearable will be the token gating.

**Q5: Music NFT has the power to completely change the trajectory of an artist's career, do you think it’s true?**

I think it is. Before, artists have to sign contracts with record labels, and the record label gives artists what they think they should have. Now with NFT, artists can have their own product, they can sell it and say how much percent they get on the smart contract, so they can have their own generational wealth. They have their own royalty for their own and their fans to come. it's a more decentralized method for benefiting. The only problem is the record label has a lot of money to market the artist, when you don't have those you have to work by yourself to push it, it’s hard. But if you focus and put your time into it, then you can grow it. But any new experience takes time, but i believe it will change dramatically, just because of the use case and how much technology it has behind it. So everyone has the same opportunity now.
