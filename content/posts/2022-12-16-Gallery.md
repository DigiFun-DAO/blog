Wanting to expand beyond the experiment with traditional gallery function, we asked: what would a digital gallery look like and what would its process be like? This question led us on a multi-month journey during which we collaborated with an amazing group 01a1. The result is a wearable galley, that celebrates creativity, and highlights differences and similarities between different metaverse, and how digital experience pervades our human experience and pushes us to rethink the often artificial spatial segregation of art along the lines of dominant classification schemes such as aesthetic style, medium, scale, identity, etc.

The gallery captures an individual’s creativity and creative intention, while together, the pieces reflect a broad scope of creative expression not often seen in the same space or context.fashion and art via artist interviews, asking questions directly to the viewers about their experiences or their own take on virtual life identities.

Also, we have prepared Giveaways and exclusive POAPs for this event.
