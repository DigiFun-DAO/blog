On December 2nd, the DigiFun X 01a1 gallery opening exhibition officially started, and it was a very special guided tour to celebrate the opening. For those who attended the event in Decentraland, they could send a screenshot of watching this live broadcast to DigiFun's Discord Chinese section with their wallet address to get a limited edition POAP. After the live broadcast, we had a random drawing and selected 6 winners to send one piece of metaverse wearable each.

The tour is located at Decentraland coordinates (16, -66) and will be led by Masha from DigiFun. The entire parade will depart from the first level to the third level, and then we hopped over to the venues of four other project parties with the highest reputation in the Chinese community to hear their stories, [Soulmagic](https://twitter.com/soulmagicnft?s=21&t=iwUS08qCpdXbWYIBsjvsHA), [Metatrekkers](https://mobile.twitter.com/metatrekkers), [Dragoncity](https://mobile.twitter.com/DragonCityIO) and [Metadoge](https://mobile.twitter.com/MetaGamiMall).

Several guests who came to the scene were MOMO from DigiFun, Tracy from 01a1, Benjy from SoulMagic, Chirs from Metatrekkers, Janice from DragonCity and Charlie from metadoge, who took everyone on a tour of their venues and gave a lively talk.

At the same time，Dragoncity, the landmark at (98, -67) , is one of the largest project parties in the Decentraland land area. Dragoncity not only carries Chinese culture on this land, but they are also one of the official partners of MVFW(Metaverse Fashion Week), and in the upcoming 2023 MVFW, Dragoncity is again the official partner of Asia. During this event, Janice took us on a tour of the land.

Currently, Digifun is gaining popularity and reputation in decentraland, and has collaborated with many brands such as Cider, KINGWEN, NFT project Thiersverse, and many famous designers such as Yaping Chen's Five Elements series that you will see on the first floor of the exhibition. Their own team modeled and collaborated to design the wearable into Decentraland.

The event was led by MOMO who led a tour of the DigiFun portion of the gallery, which was inspired by Polygon. The spirit of decentralization, distribution, and the concept of scattered links all contributed to the styling of the gallery.

**01a1**
