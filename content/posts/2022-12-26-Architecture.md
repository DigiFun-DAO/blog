We arrived at the final stop of the DigiFun Gallery opening event, a Twitter space AMA where we invited several guests to discuss architecture in the metaverse and the possibilities that the future will experience,hosted by DigiFun@DigiFun_.

Invited to participate in the event were the decentraland-focused project, [Dragon City龙城](https://twitter.com/DragonCityIO), [QPJDoc](https://twitter.com/DocQpj) from project 01A1, and [1∑xistence](https://twitter.com/ExistentialNoHo), an independent creator active in decentraland.

I'm pretty sure our audience here already knows about metavers, especially The Sandbox and Decentraland. So since last year the space has invited all types of industry. So recently did you find that you have also collaborated with 01A1 to launch a gallery in the central land. With the exciting technology tools, you can break many physical boundaries and give the creator more imagination, while we have just started building.

So this is going to be a very early stage for us because we've always been just playing around with wearables. We are excited to hear from the other two big projects in Decentraland and from Sandbox to hear about them so I have listed some questions so they can discuss it with all of us and we also have our beloved Decentraland community.So you can start to introduce yourself and your project.

**Dragon City 龙城**

**@DragonCityIO**

Hello,I'm Janice from Dragon City. So Dragon City basically is a Chinese style,in the landmark at (98, -67) , and is one of the largest project parties in the Decentraland land area. Dragon City not only carries Chinese culture on this land, but they are also one of the official partners of MVFW(Metaverse Fashion Week), and in the upcoming 2023 MVFW, Dragon City is again the official partner of Asia.

**@DocQpj**

It's my great honor to be here. I'm Joshua from 01A1.01A1 is a creative community founded by pioneering metaverse enthusiasts, with members from different fields such as Web3 development, game design and architectural design, who came together to promote metaverse applications and scenarios. The community adheres to the tenet of “artist-centered and art innovation-oriented” and continues to create, hoping to virtualize the best artworks in life in different forms and present them on the metaverse platform.01a1 is currently working on The Sandbox, one of the earliest creative teams in Asia.

First let me say thank you for inviting me. It's an honor to be up here with Dragon City and DigiFun. Basically, I have done many art showcases co-hosting while Yapping Chen dresses, the elemental dresses which were magnificent.

I've also started co-hosting a brand new tournament for rock, paper, Scissors within the metaverse. Sounds crazy, but I could challenge myself more to dive in and really learn what they do. So I've started dabbling with art and have created a few small collections.

My next step is to investigate and try to learn to be a builder and blender.So hopefully I can actually build this, do some architecture within Decentraland one day.Thank you.

**Q1:How did you get new architectures started?**

**DigiFun**

**@DigiFun_**

We would love to hear what you guys think about a more immersive experience and how we can build new architectures and metaphors. So my question is how did you get started?Did you start mimicking the real world and reflect how you perceive reality or how?

**QPJDoc**

**@DocQpj**

Actually we have two designers who are from the real world architecture business.And they started in charge of the design work. I think they were not following the physical.We didn't really build the real world stuff, we started from a virtual one.

**Dragon City 龙城**

**@DragonCityIO**

Dragon City,by the name itself, you also can tell that it's about China, but actually, it's about  Asians and actually we would like to promote China. We have been in Decentraland for two years.When did decentraland start and then we have a Dragon city there as well.

So how do we think about the physical world? How do we bring the physical world design into the digital world?Have a lot of different buildings and it's all in different kinds of categories. Like you have the fantastic land which is like a very punk place and you also have like normal Chinese visuals. So  it'll be interesting to see if you guys are trying to explore more textures.

Actually for us our insight is like we think that we have a lot of possibilities and it is even more easy to make a building in the physical world. So you can see we have many dragon symbols in our venue.

The physical world is so limited to create this kind of thing,so later on when there is some chance I can go into details of some venues to you guys to share some of other hidden gems.

**@ExistentialNoHo**

First I have to mention this too one of the collections I created, called unique homes.

I climbed up a mountain.It's round and goes very high up.And it has chains.Leading out from that or down towards the middle, coming down, draped down and out towards the edge.

So it's quite different, just like in the airport.

You just hop on and hold your luggage and it carries you down or monorail to take you around your entire lay of the land, that would be awesome. It's a home made into a very large trunk of a tree.

Turned out pretty cool and some mountain homes that look pretty nice.

**Q2: What do you think are the key components of an immersive experience in the metaverse?**

**QPJDoc**

**@DocQpj**

Complete metaverse and the Improve the Interaction,that's important.AI can help us make money in metaverse.I am quite inspired from that.

Both these two platforms still have a lot of potentials.I'm not quite sure about Decentraland.

As for the Sandbox, because I'm more familiar with the sandbox and they have a lot of.Fantastic at this moment and they have a lot of potential to do in the future.

So the most straightforward way to do that is like，we have put a lot of images, images and 3D models of our NFTs on.

In the sandbox and in decentraland we can put like some website link on Twitter so users can interact with.

**Dragon City 龙城**

**@DragonCityIO**

For my team, we would like to do something beyond their physical world. So for the coming years, you will see there's so many changes in Dragon City and some of the revenue, like I said before, we would like to come by. We want to be connected because right now, we have a lot of revenue in  Dragon City,they don't have much connection with each other. So in the coming years,we will have some changings, We will not just copy from the physical world.Instead we have something that is like in our imaginations because my team is always so creative.

We don't really like to copy things into Dragon City, instead we copied our physical world like the small Chinatown from the physical world to  Dragon City in Decentraland. But this is the foundation because we think that is the foundation of Dragon City. Anyways we still have to have a bit of Chinese style in it.You will see a mix and match,we will have a more punk style or of the venue. I'm not sure if I make it clear enough.In the future maybe I can just guide you guys to have a walk and also refer to existence.

**Q3:Are you guys continuously trying to explore more materials about the textures?**

**QPJDoc**

**@DocQpj**

Yes, textures are important and I think one way to create such textures is tricky.

Existence is kind of an expert on it. It's like we can use stable diffusion or other kinds of AI and generative tools to create such textures and it is kind of useful at this moment. It can be used now. I have seen a lot of research about what they have implemented.

Script tools onto Photoshop or Blender or 2D.

Tools so they can draw basics.Ideas about textures and use the generative AI tool to make it more mature, which is fantastic.

I think in the next few months we will do our own research about this and see if we can create textures which are suitable for Sandbox by using generative AI.Thank you.

DigiFun is just starting out in the field of architecture. In today's Twitter space, we learned from the rich experience and creativity of other project parties, thanks to their selfless sharing, and I believe that in the near future, we can see everyone's ideas become reality!
