DigiFun's fashion collaboration with the Forbidden City at the MVFW

**Highlight of MVFW2022**

Opened on Thursday, March 24, 2022 on the virtual real estate platform Decentraland, MVFW is the largest digital fashion event to date. It was open to anyone and over the course of four days, ongoing events included a number of shows, as well as showrooms, stores, panels, virtual parties and NFT drops. It has also become a major crossover event for mainstream fashion, with brands like Paco Rabanne, Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, Tommy Hilfiger, Dundas and Cavalli joining digital fashion companies like Auroboros and DressX.

As an original, completely digital fashion brand, DigiFun also participated in the fashion week, showcasing dozens of original wearable pieces during the runway and party, and the impact we made was certainly unexpected. DigiFun's wearable piece Emperor's Golden Dragon Robe, a collaboration with the Forbidden City, drew particular attention during the show, and fashion magazine Vogue covering the fashion week, specifically selected Emperor's Golden Dragon Robe as one of the hit products, something we hadn't envisioned at all.

Many brands began purchasing and leasing land in Decentraland as a way to lay out and sell products in the metaverse. luxury brands such as Dolce & Gabbana and Etro opened stores that debuted during fashion week, and luxury retailer Selfridges launched its flagship store during fashion week, which included an exclusive NFT art gallery for visitors.

In addition to the ability to purchase, the look and feel is important - it's the set design, soundtrack and overall vibe that sets the live fashion show apart.This is an absolutely fantastic opportunity to expand the world of brands and their cultural vibe in ways never before possible.

In the future, it will combine more technologies to enhance brand content and create a meta-universe clothing brand.

DigiFun has worked with major traditional fashion brands to customize virtual wearable NFTs, including fast fashion brand Cider, and individual designers such as KINGWEN. These fashions were all showcased at the first Metaverse Fashion Week at Decentraland in 2022.
