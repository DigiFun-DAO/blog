**Date**: July 8th 2022

**Time**: 8-9 pm EST

**Coords**: 18,-66

DigiFun collaborated with Chinese female designer Chen Yaping on a wood-themed dress from the Chinese "Five Elements" collection, which we launched at the DigiFun building (18,-66) with DJ serenaelis! We then celebrated the women in Web 3. We are also celebrating the women in Web 3 and have invited some female guests to share their experiences in Web 3 . Lucky audience members who came to participate won giveaways and POAPS!

**Design Concept**

The "Source" in the Original Source collection is diverse, multidimensional and multifaceted. The series of digital ritual fashion "Original Source '' combines the structure of traditional ritual clothing, the structure of artifacts, and the internal and external relationship between the five emotions, the five elements, and the five organs in traditional Chinese culture to build a connection between the virtual world and reality, allowing the real and the virtual to merge in the digital fashion.

Through the exploration and application of digital fashion, we express the multiple possibilities of traditional culture in the new context, and at the same time propose a new perspective on the continuation of cultural lineage.

In this wood gown, we can see that there are many branches growing outward on the dress, and the edge of the dress is also composed of the shape of wood.  Wood is a warm material, we want people who wear dresses to be warm and elegant. The blue glow makes the skirt very beautiful day and night.

**Designer Intro**

Chen Yaping has always been committed to the discovery and innovation of traditional cultural elements, and in November 2020, when the design of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics award dresses was open to the public, Yaping Chen 's "RuiXueXiangYun" design finally became one of the three sets of Winter Olympics award dresses, and was used in the award ceremonies of all snow venues. For more than a year, she was personally involved in all the design and production.

By chance, Yaping Chen was invited to participate in Decentraland, the world's largest virtual fashion week. With the mindset of experimentation, she released her first design in the meta-universe and received a design award from Dragon City.
