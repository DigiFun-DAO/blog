      <description>How did DigiFun start？ DigiFun was founded in October 2021 by four partners who were passionate about blockchain technology and NFTs.
DigiFun is a communication, production, and investment platform for digital entertainment in the Metaverse, managed in the form of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). It’s a mechanism based on UGC to design more user autonomous products to promote its development.
At first, DigiFun noticed that there was a large group of people who couldn&amp;rsquo;t draw, didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to model or other techniques, but they had a lot of interesting and creative ideas.</description>
